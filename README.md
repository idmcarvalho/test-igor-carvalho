# Simple-chat

A simple chat application in nodejs and mongodb. It can be served local or in the cloud.
There's a docker file and a github actions workflow set to build this docker image from DockerHub on a EC2 Ubuntu instance.

Obs: You'll need to create and configure your own EC2 key pairs to properly authenticate in the instance.
